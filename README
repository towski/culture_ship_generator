Run setup.rb to generate the yml files of ship names to ignore

Then run classify.rb. cl.classify "text" will tell you if a ship name
fits in with the existing bayesian data. 

The bayes classifier is trained on all the ship names, some personally
generated ship names, as well as the full text of the Consider Phelbas novel. 

The negative ship names are taken from 28_000 real world ship names that
are probably too cheesy or lame.
